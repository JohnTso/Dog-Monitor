# Dog-Monitor
My semester project, build a health monitor device with Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense

* To set up the environment, make sure to run these commands first
```shell
brew install arduino-cli
```

* If you already have arduino-cli, remember to install the following libraries
```shell
arduino-cli core install arduino:mbed
arduino-cli lib install Arduino_LSM9DS1
arduino-cli lib install Arduino_HTS221
```

* If you do not have cpplint installed still, run
```shell
pip3 install cpplint
```
